# Tesla Stock Price Prediction through MFCC Feature Extraction and LSTM Modeling

This repository contains the code, datasets, and resources for the Master's thesis titled "Using MFCC Feature Extraction Combined with LSTM Models for Stock Price Prediction â€” A Case Study on Tesla's Stock Prices." The thesis focuses on utilizing Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) to transform stock price data into audio signals, which are then analyzed using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for predicting stock price trends.
